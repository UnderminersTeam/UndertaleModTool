# UndertaleModTool Super Usable

A fork of [AwfulNasty's fork](https://github.com/AwfulNasty/UndertaleModTool/tree/RoomEditorChanges) of [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool) that adds even more stuff, still mainly for Pizza Tower modding.

# Features
- Can open scr_player_mach3
- Button to add creation code to rooms and objects in rooms
- Types for some Pizza Tower stuff (like `spr_*` variables for characterspr)
- Additional functions
- Maybe more to come in the future!
