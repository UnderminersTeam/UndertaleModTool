name: Decompiler bug report
about: Create a report about specific GML VM code that fails to correctly decompile
title: ''
labels: bug, decompiler
assignees: ''

---

**Incorrect output observed**
```
Put incorrect output from the decompiler here (or any stacktraces/error messages)
```

**Expected output**
```
Put expected (or original) GML code output here, or otherwise describe the expected behavior if unclear.
```

**VM assembly**
```
Paste VM assembly of the code here, e.g. from another tool like UndertaleModTool.
If this is not possible, that is okay, as long as the original/expected GML is known, or the game is free and can be linked in the "additional context."
```

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here, such as any other observations or info about the game the code is found in.
